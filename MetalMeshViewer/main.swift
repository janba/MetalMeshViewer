// Following advice from Ryan Theodore which was written up in the Medium article:
// "Creating macOS apps without a storyboard or .xib file with Swift 5",
// we are making this app without any .xib files or storyboard. It is simply so
// complicated to figure out the interactions between the visual representation of the
// interface and the code that it is better to do without. However, it means that we
// need to create a few globals manually below.
